🪙DAI + ⚙️FRAX = 🦊FOX
```

**Fractional Over Collateralized Stablecoin (FOX)** is the first over-collateralized stablecoin that achieves strikingly capital efficiency. Like [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/), FOX gets tokens (ETH, etc.) as collateral. On the other hand, FOX works like [FRAX](https://frax.finance), which partially relies on the seigniorage algorithmic method.
