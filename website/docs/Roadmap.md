# Roadmap

After the full implementation and numerous tests, FOX Finance will be launched through a fair method.

In addition, because FOX is inspired by DAI and FRAX, we are under consideration for airdrops for those service users.

Several feature updates are also scheduled to make the protocol more robust and convenient.

```
ðŸ‘€ Please keep an eye on FOX-Finance!
